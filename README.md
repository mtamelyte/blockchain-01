<h1>Hash function - Blockchain Technologies Course</h1>
<p>This is a repository, created for my Blockchain Technologies course in university, which contains a custom hash function, written by me with no resources on how to implement one (v0.1) and improved using Claude AI (v0.2), while maintaining the original idea of the hash - using a seed derived from the UTF-8 value of the input characters to semi-randomly adjust each of the characters of a 64-character hexadecimal hash while rotating the hash between changes to ensure avalanche effect.</p>
<h2>Strengths</h2>
<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<h3>Test files</h3>
<p>The repository contains several files, which were used to run tests during the coding of this hash. They are contained in the "files" subdirectory</p>
